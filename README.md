This is a browser-based street brawler game. Two characters, Crash and Sam, take turns attacking eachother in a single or double attack, or can heal themselves using the Recover action during that turn. Double and Recover cost SP, and can no longer use SP if the SP bars number is lower than the required SP to use the action. The game is completed when either Crash or Sam's HP bar goes to 0.

Notes on the game:
* The amount of turns everygame is infinite, but usually a game lasts 8 - 13 turns
* The maximum amount of health any side can have is 100, but a vanilla game usually allows 50 health points before SP runs out.
* The maximum amount of damage each attack can do is 10. (which means a double attack at the start of the game has the potency to cause a OHKO (One Hit Knock-Out ))
